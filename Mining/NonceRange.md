## Nonce Range

Nonce is a 32 bit integer that is used to generate a hash. Range of nonce is 0 to 2^32-1.

Total number of hashes possible is 16^64 ~ 10^77.

There are not enough nonces to generate a valid hash.

A modest mines does 10^8 hashes/sec.

So total number of nonce, 4*10^9 just take 40 seconds to be exhausted.
