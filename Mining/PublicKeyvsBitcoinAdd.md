## Public key vs Bitcoin address

To verify the particular transaction is valid, we need to verify the transaction signature. Message, signature and public key are the three fields that are required to verify the signature. They are passed through the verification function and the result is returned. Result is either true or false.

**Bitcoin Address**

A Bitcoin address is a unique identifier that serves as a virtual location where the cryptocurrency can be sent.
