## Heirarchial Deterministic Wallets

Master Private key-> Private Key1-> Public Key1-> Address1

Master Private key+1 -> Private Key2-> Public Key2-> Address2

A hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet is a digital wallet commonly used to store the digital keys for holders of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Anyone with a copy of both the public and password-like private key can control the cryptocurrency in the account. 

To prevent hacking these keys must be randomly generated and backed up in the wallet.
