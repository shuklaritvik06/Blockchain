# IPFS

**Why IPFS?**

As we all know that a Dapp or Decentralized Application consists of a Front end and smart contract. If your Dapp also need to store files. So now what should we do?

We have two options to solve this problem:

- Either connect the frontend to the server and then store and retrieve files but then it will have a big part of centralized entity that is the server. So this is not the optimal solution we are looking for ðŸ¤”
- These problems are solved by IPFS.

**What is IPFS?**

IPFS or Interplanetary File System is a peer to peer, decentralized and distributed filesystem. IPFS uses two data structures to distribute the files, they are: 

 - Distributed Hash Table
 - Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph

It uses Content Addressing rather than Location addressing.

**Location Addressing**

Suppose when you navigate to specific website page then it send the request to the server and it sends back the response so it is a form of location addressing where we are using URL (uniform resource locator) to locate that page and get back the response from the server.

**Content Addressing**

When we upload a file on IPFS be it either doc, video or audio, IPFS performs hashing and assigns a Hash to that content, now when we want to get that content we use that hash not a location.

So it is like we are using name  of the file not location here.

**IPFS vs HTTP**

|  IPFS   | HTTP |
|:---:|:--:|
| Use Content Addressing  | Use Location Addressing  |
| No one is a boss   |  Owner control it  |
|  It is much more efficient   |  Not much efficient  |
|  User data is persistent   |  User data is not persistent  |
|  It can't go down, there are many nodes connected, if one gos down, we can get the data from the other nodes  | It can go down   |

**Working of IPFS**

Suppose five computers A,B,C,D,E are connected to each other, and user upload a file to IPFS, it is cached in the memory of A, now suppose computer B wants that file so it will send the request, and computer A will send a copy of that file to computer B, now suppose as computer A and B both have that file, and computer C asks for that file, then acc to the IPFS protocol, chunks of data will be transferred to it from both of the computers A and B. Suppose now node A and B are down, and D want that file, it can get that file from C.

This is how IPFS works.

**Pin Files using IPFS**

As we have learnt that when we upload a file to IPFS it is stored in our cache memory, but we know that garbage collector cleans the cache memory on a regular basis to ensure our computer efficient performance, so what to do when we don't want garbage collector to remove the cached data on our memory? , We can pin that data to our local node to keep that forever until we unpin it, or we can definitely use other 3rd party services but we have to pay them then as we are using their space.
