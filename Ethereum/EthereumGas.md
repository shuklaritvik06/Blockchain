Ethereum Gas is the cost of running a transaction. It is a unit of measurement for the amount of computational power needed for executing specific operations on the network.

- Any transaction that modifies the blockchain costs gas.
- The user that generates the transaction is charged for the gas.

**Gas Price**

It is the amount the sender wants to pay per unit of gas to the transaction mined. gasPrice is set by the user.

Gas prices are denoted in GWEI. 

1 GWEI= 10^-9 ETH

The higher the gas price, the faster the transaction is mined. It is just like the transaction in Bitcoin.

**Gas Limit**

It is the maximum gas the transaction can consume. It is set by the user.  

Total Fee = Gas Limit * Gas Price per unit

If more gas Limit is set the extra part would be returned.

Gas Limit is like agar isse jyada le to bhaiya aukat ke bahar h.
