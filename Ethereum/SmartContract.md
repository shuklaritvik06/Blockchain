Bitcoing Script is the language used in Bitcoin. And Solidity is the language used in Ethereum.

Bitcoin Script is not Turing Complete, whereas Solidity is Turing Complete.

Bitcoin Founder argued that time, that suppose if any hacker or so, ran infinite loop then bitcoin would be down, creating problems for everyone.

Vitalik argued that we can have the concept to take money if we want to run a program on the blockchain. More operation more is the gas.
