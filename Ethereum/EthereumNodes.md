## Ethereum Nodes

Ethereum is also based on P2P network. Types of Nodes in ethereum network are:

1. Full Node
2. Light Node
3. Archive Node

Full Node has the work to validate and verify entire transactions that are going on. 

- It has entire copy of blockchain stored locally.
- It verifies and validates all the blocks.

Light Node is a node which has low power which cannot afford to store the gigabytes of data, it stores only the block header. It depends on full node.

Suppose Full Node is like a Book and Light Node is like a Page.

Archive Node is a node which stores everything kept in the full node and built an archive of historical data. Requires terabytes of storage.
