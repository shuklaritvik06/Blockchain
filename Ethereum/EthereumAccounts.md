## Ethereum Accounts

An ethereum account is an entity with an ether balance that can send or recieve transactions.

Types of Accounts in Ethereum:

1. Externally Owned Account
2. Contract Account

Externally Owned Accounts:

This is the account which is created when we create a wallet. Now to access this EOA we need a password? And that password is a private key.

With EOA we can check balance, send transactions, recieve transactions, and interact with smart contracts.

Contract Accounts:

This is a account which is controlled by contract code. This is created when our contract code is deployed.

**EOA VS CA**
