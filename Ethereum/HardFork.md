## Hard Fork

On 20.07.2016 after the DAO attack, the ethereum community discussed about this situation. So the ethereum community divided into two groups:

1. Ethereum Classic
2. Ethereum

Ethereum Classic was the old chain which think that we have to follow the principles.

Ethereum is the new chain which think that we have to bring changes in the smart contract.

They split after 1919999 block.

**Hard Fork**

During Hard fork, software implementing a protocol and its mining procedures were upgraded.

Once a user upgrades their software that version rejects all the transactions from older software, effectively creating a new branch od the blockhain.

However, those users who retain the old software are able to continue using it.
