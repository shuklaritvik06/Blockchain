## Soft Fork

Soft fork are a change to the protocolm but the end product remains unchanged.

Soft fork is a backward compatibe upgrade, meaning that the upgraded nodes can still communicate with the non-upgraded ones.

Old nodes could still validate the transactions but they just would not understand them.
