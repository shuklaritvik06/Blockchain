## Sharding

Split the Blockchain in different small databases. Now different set of networks will interact with these different databases.

Now the Load on the network decreases and more transaction can be processed, rather than validating the transaction in the main database, the transaction is validated in the shard databases.

Benefits of Sharding:

1. Transaction per second increases.
2. More validators will join
3. Expensive comp not needed
4. Energy consumption is reduced
