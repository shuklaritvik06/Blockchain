## Blockchain Mining Overview

Suppose you do a transaction with your friend for a pizza, this will be stored in a mempool. This is important as this is the area from where miners will pick the transactions and create a block.

They have to solve a problem to create a block. This problem is called Proof of Work. 

After the creation of block it is not necessary that it will be added to the blockchain. 

This miner will send the message to the other nodes that "Hey, I have added a block to my chain, please verify and add to yours too" Other nodes will verify the block and add it to their chain.

As it is important to verify that does this miner followed all the steps and if it is valid, then it will be added to the blockchain.

And the miner is rewarded for the block.

This is a Blockchain Mining.
