## Consensus Protocol

Types of Consensus Protocols:

1. Proof of Work
2. Proof of Stake
3. Others

## Proof Of Work

We have studied till now that if attacker corrupt the block data, it will take the data from the other nodes in the chain. 

Suppose if the attacker tried to attach the malicious node in the last then as there are no nodes after that so we would not be able to know it too.

So now we will see how to deal these situations using consensus protocol.

Now as we know that the miner has to solve a computation problem to attach the block to the chain. And the problem is very much time consuming, and electricity is also used very much.

If Miner do any kind of malicious activity, then their efforts will be wasted, and the incentive will not be given.

And when the other nodes know that the new block is added to A they will verify the transaction and if it is not valid then it will not be added to the chain. And the verification does not take much time.
