## P2P Network

**Centralized Network**

A centralized network has a server and clients connected to it. The client request the server for data and server give them data back.

Disadvantage of centralized network is that it is slow and it is not secure.

**P2P Network**

P2P network is a network where each node is connected to other nodes. The nodes communicate with each other using a network protocol. If a hacker is able to connect to a node, and tamper the data. That node can take the data from other nodes.

Suppose there are five nodes and each node has their copy of blockchain. If A does any transaction and adds the block to their chain, it will tell other nodes, that " Hey, I have added a block to my chain, please verify and add to yours too" Other nodes will verify the block and add it to their chain. This is how P2P network works.

### Why we need P2P network?

Suppose if a hacker is able to connect to a node, and tamper the data. That node can take the data from other nodes. P2P network is a way to help in this.

**How block gets the data from other nodes?**

Suppose hacker hacks the data in a block of A and it corrupts the blocks after it too. Now the miners will send the message to A that "Hey Dude, your blockchain is not matching with ours, and as we are in majority you have to change your chain with ours.
