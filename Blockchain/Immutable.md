## Immutable Ledger

Suppose you bought a house and give the document to the government. It has 2 ways to store the data.

Way 1: Will be stored in a database(centralized).
Way 2: A register will be maintained.

Suppose as it is centralized the data can be changed by any one. The database can also be hacked by the hackers. So we have only one option, to trust the government.

So here comes our savior, Blockchain.

Suppose hacker comes and try to tamper the data. As we have learned Avalanche Effect the blocks afterwards will be corrupted.
