## Hashing Algorithm

As you know that blockchain is a chain of blocks. So each block contains a hash of the previous block to identify the block. It is like a fingerprint of that block.

It generates using SHA-256 algorithm. This has 64 Hexadecimal characters and each character is of 4 bits. So it is 256 bits.

First Block in the blockchain has a previous hash of 000000000 and it is also called as Genesis Block.

Five requirements of Hashing Algorithm:

    1. It is a one way algorithm.
    2. It is a deterministic algorithm.
    3. It is a fast algorithm.
    4. Withstand Collisions // Non Hackable.
    5. Avalanche Effect. // If the document is changed so that the hash is different.
