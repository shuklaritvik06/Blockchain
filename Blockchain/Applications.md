## Applications of Blockchain

There are many applications of blockchain. But we will focus on some applications like:

1. Product Tracking
2. Smart Contracts
3. Health Care
4. International wire transfer

## Product Tracking

Suppose you have a product and you want to track the product. You can do it by using a database called blockchain.

It can have a bar code which can be scanned by phone app, and it will show the product information.

## Smart Contracts

Smart Contract is a program which run on ethereum blockchain.

Smart contract will run depending on the conditions it has, and if the condition passes automatically it will execute and A will get the payment. So it will maintain the trust.

## Health Care

Suppose there is City A and City B. City A stores data in its database. Suppose for any condition person has to go to City B hospital and it want the data from City A.

Don't confuse it with the centralized system, it is the blockchain of person where he have given write permission to City A. And read permission is given to City B.

## International wire transfer

Sender Bank -> Correspondent Bank -> Receiver Bank

It is a Time taking process. There are some disadvantages of centralized system:

1. Huge Fees
2. Time Taking
